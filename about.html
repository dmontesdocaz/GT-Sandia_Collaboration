<p>The objective of this project is to take advantage of the computational advances in big data and data mining techniques for big data sets to establish a low dimensional linkage between the structure of a Micro Structure and a determined property. </p>


<p>The data-sets have been kindly provided by Sandia National Lab and consist of SPPARKS, grain growth software also developed by Sandia, files. The simulations performed model the grain growth of a 2D area of 1000x1000 pixels and result in a polycrystalline material. </p>


<p>The data science approach by which this linkage will be developed is comprised of 4 main steps:</p>


<p>1.	Generation of a representative calibration data set.</p>


<p>2.	Identifying the salient features of the Microstructure as well as establishing efficient methods to quantify it.</p>


<p>3.	Dimensionality reduction of the quantified data.</p>


<p>4.	Linkage establishment by multilinear regression fit of the dimensionally reduced data and validation via Leave One Out Cross Validation (LOOCV).</p>



<p>The fact that the linkage will be developed using a data-driven approach ensures that the model has built-in modularity and scalability. These capabilities make the model expansion a relatively easy task, consequently demonstrating the power of data-science approach to solve material science problems.</p>
