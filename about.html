The objective of this project is to take advantage of the computational advances in big data and data mining techniques for big data sets to establish a low dimensional linkage between the structure of a Micro Structure and a determined property. 

The data-sets have been kindly provided by <a href="http://www.sandia.gov/" Sandia National Lab</a> and consist of SPPARKS, grain growth software also developed by Sandia, files. The simulations performed model the grain growth of a 2D area of 1000x1000 pixels and result in a polycrystalline material. 

The data science approach by which this linkage will be developed is comprised of 4 main steps:

1.	Generation of a representative calibration data set.
2.	Identifying the salient features of the Microstructure as well as establishing efficient methods to quantify it.
3.	Dimensionality reduction of the quantified data.
4.	Linkage establishment by multilinear regression fit of the dimensionally reduced data and validation via Leave One Out Cross Validation (LOOCV).

The fact that the linkage will be developed using a data-driven approach ensures that the model has built-in modularity and scalability. These capabilities make the model expansion a relatively easy task, consequently demonstrating the power of data-science approach to solve material science problems.
